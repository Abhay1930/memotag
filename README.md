## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Component-based UI development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions and effects

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express**: Server for handling form submissions
- **RESTful API**: Endpoints for contact form and waitlist signup
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing contact form and waitlist entries
- **Render**: Cloud hosting for PostgreSQL database and backend API

## üìã Project Structure

This project consists of two main parts:

- `client/`: React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- `server/`: Express.js backend for form handling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memotag.git
   cd memotag
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or http://localhost:5174 if port 5173 is in use)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://memotag_user:password@hostname/database_name
   ```

   Note: Replace the DATABASE_URL with your actual PostgreSQL connection string from Render.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000

### Running Both Frontend and Backend

You'll need to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously in separate terminal windows to have the full application working.

### PostgreSQL Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database on Render:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "New" and select "PostgreSQL"
   - Configure your database with a name, region, and plan
   - Click "Create Database"

2. Once created, Render will provide you with:
   - Internal Database URL
   - External Database URL
   - Username and password

3. Update your server's `.env` file with the database connection string:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database_name
   ```

4. The server will automatically create the necessary tables when it starts up.

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database on Render as described in the PostgreSQL Database Setup section

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository
   - In the Render dashboard, click "New" and select "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure the service:
     - Root Directory: `server` (if your Express code is in a server folder)
     - Environment: `Node`
     - Build Command: `npm install`
     - Start Command: `node server.js`
   - Add environment variables:
     - `PORT`: 5000
